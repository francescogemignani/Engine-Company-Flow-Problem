### Description
The problem assigned consists how a company transports its engines from the plants to the warehouses, and from the warehouses to the distributors, by satisfying all the stated constraints and minimizing the total cost. Decisions refer to a single day. We propose a linear integer problem (ILP) to formulate the problem. Then, we implement the proposed model by means of the modeling language AMPL, and solve it using the optimization solver CPLEX. For more details read the [report](https://github.com/francescogemignani/Engine-Company-Flow-Problem/blob/main/engine_company.pdf).

### Course Objectives
The course presents the structure and functions of logistics systems, analyzing major
decision problems arising in the medium/long term (tactical/strategic decisions). After an introduction to the main characteristics of logistics systems, with emphasis on
distribution logistics, optimization models for decision support are discussed. Some
relevant models and methods are then illustrated with the aid of appropriate software
tools, and logistics case studies are presented.
